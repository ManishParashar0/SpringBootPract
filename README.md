Opinionated configuration: Spring Boot adopts an opinionated approach to configuration. It provides sensible defaults and auto-configuration based on the classpath dependencies present in the project. This minimizes the need for manual configuration and reduces boilerplate code.

Embedded web server: Spring Boot includes an embedded web server, such as Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow, which allows you to run web applications without needing to deploy them to a separate server. The embedded server is automatically configured based on your classpath dependencies.

Auto-configuration: Spring Boot offers automatic configuration for various components and frameworks, such as data access, messaging, security, and more. It scans the classpath and configures these components based on the libraries available, reducing the manual setup required.

Starter dependencies: Spring Boot provides a rich set of starter dependencies, which are curated dependencies that include everything needed to start developing applications for a specific purpose. For example, the "spring-boot-starter-web" dependency includes everything needed to build web applications, including the embedded server, Spring MVC, and other related libraries.

Actuator: Spring Boot Actuator provides built-in management and monitoring endpoints for your application. It offers insights into application health, metrics, logging, and other useful information, helping you manage and monitor your application in production.

Spring Boot CLI: The Spring Boot Command-Line Interface (CLI) allows you to quickly bootstrap and develop Spring Boot applications using a command-line interface. It provides a convenient way to run, test, and package Spring Boot applications without the need for a full-fledged IDE.

Devtools: Spring Boot Devtools is a set of developer-focused tools that provide automatic application restarts, LiveReload support, and enhanced development-time experience. It helps in improving development productivity by reducing the turnaround time for code changes.

Production-ready features: Spring Boot provides production-ready features out of the box, such as security, monitoring, logging, and distributed tracing. It integrates well with other Spring projects and third-party libraries, making it suitable for building scalable and resilient applications.

Spring Boot promotes convention over configuration and eliminates much of the boilerplate code associated with traditional Spring applications. It simplifies the development process and allows developers to focus more on writing business logic rather than dealing with infrastructure and configuration details.
